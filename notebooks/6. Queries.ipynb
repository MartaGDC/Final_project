I watched from a few seats away, ashamed at invading their privacy, yet utterly enraptured. I'd struggled with being a lesbian for so, so long, struggled with accepting myself and struggling with the realization that I probably don't have a future. Seeing the two of them there, just being themselves and being in love, gave me hope. They gave me hope that maybe I could be happy one day, too.

Then you said \"if we were in a movie you'd kiss me now\" and looked me straight in the eye. But I didn't, because I didn't want to lose you. And we slept in the same bed, holding each other, while I longed for you and you played with my heart until you broke it. I don't blame you anymore and I'm thankful for the memories.

Anyway, couple of months later, we meet in Barcelona and on the first night we're trying to locate each other ... eventually I find you in a square, with beautiful lights all around and a fountain in the middle. There you were, on the phone to me, by the fountain but had not seen me yet. I stood there for a few seconds before running up to you to just watch you. I still remember the way your eyes took me in when I turned you around. I remember how sweet your kisses were and how soft your eyes were for me... We're are not together now and you could've treated me way better. Sometimes I wonder what your significance should mean to me; were you the one who got away? Or maybe it's not that deep; just a first, very intense love.\n",

We were walking through the garden and I tried to gather up the courage to tell you that I loved you, that I had for the past 6 months, since I had told you I might fall in love with you (but the truth was that I already held you closer to my heart than anyone before). I walked in front of you when I said it, because I was scared and didn't want to ruin us. I'm glad I didn't. I'm glad we could hold hands until I had to leave.

      "97. I loved her for 5 years, but she never knew. Our relationship had always been complicated. We fell apart, she was too broken and our friendship had become toxic for the both of us. I still love her and I wish her the best. We used to walk this street every week while we talked and laughed. I hope we can do it again somewhen in the future.\n",

      "102. we had our first kiss here. i put my hands on your face and you flinched. that's pretty embarrassing for you. but you were pretty and sweet and i liked you then and i love you now. you're my best friend.\n",
      "103. we were laying in bed and i told you i love you for the first time. ever since i love you more every day and im so happy i can share my life with you <3\n",
      "104. we texted for six months before we could see each other. it was almost november and the air was chill. i knew i did not loved you the first time i touched your skin. but i did like your hair, your giggling laughter and the tone of your voice, i liked that you were smarter than me and the fact that you knew it. i would have adored that you would  let me kiss your lips then. but god knows i am thankful you didn't even make the attempt, because i cannot forgive you to this day although i remember you like a fuzzy, sour memory. \n",
      "that was one night and you broke my heart to pieces in that one week. words and words and words that i could not understand. i was standing on a hill and you kicked my back and i fell, lost in this cheerful yet lonely southern city. and. i hope you got to sleep with that one boy of your class, i hope you did it with every single of them, i really do hope they filled the void in you that i could not even reach. i hope you healed your black infected wounds, i hope your doing, so, so well. i do not love you, and i hope you hate me.\n",

      "107. we used to hung out every day here, i skipped high school some times to go see you because you didn't go to classes a lot but i wanted to know you. we listened to The black parade and Three cheers for sweet revenge for hours on repeat while we kissed. and i've never cried for love anywhere like in this place. this was like my second home, a warm refugee for the both of us, for some months.\n",
      "108. This is where everything ended. But it's where we used to meet too, where you kissed me every time we said hello or goodbye. A little and inconspicuous bridge over a green field. I have loved you, I have hated you. I learned to love with you. I'm glad we've been able to stick together, now as friends. Now each of us has his life, we're grown-ups. But sometimes, when I feel blue, I recall this golden place of my heart. I'm thankful that you exist.\n",
      "109. We came back here after almost two whole years. We took photos together like nothing had changed. Did you delete them, or have you kept them? What do you think when you see them? \n",
      "We watched the sunset from Parque del Oeste. I couldn't work up the courage to tell you I still loved you, I couldn't bear to unsettle the moment. Every sunset, every time you touched my hand, every minute of silence with you was a spiritual experience. I still can't believe we're parting ways after it all. I love you so much, and I hope that someday I can show you these messages dotted around Madrid (and beyond), and that we can laugh at the idea that we ever thought we could belong to anyone else. (I'm so sorry I wasn't where I needed to be. That apology goes more to myself than to you.)\n",
      "110. you kissed me for the first time here after we layed on the ground, hugging, for what if felt like a whole week. i think you’re the only person I’ve ever fallen in love with so far, A.\n",

Even if that meant going through The Great War. I love you and I always will. “You know, you’ll always know me”.

      "128. I was so in love with you, I wanted to do anything I could to make you the happiest girl alive. But in the end nothing worked, you turned you back on me, lied to everyone about me and decided I wasn’t worth it. I hope you’re happy because you don’t deserve the amount of love I had for you.\n",

I still don't know why. We kept talking everyday. Today, a year after, we keep talking everyday and still he makes me feel interested on him every time. Madrono 1965.\n",
      "136. It was the most beautiful day in my life. After visiting the museum we sat down in one side of the square, we looked each other in the eyes and asked to start a relationship together. We were (and still are) so much in love that this moment was the perfect one to do this ❤️\n",
      "137. Proposed to my beautiful girlfriend here. For months she has been telling me how badly she wanted to see the Ronda bridge in person. We flew to Spain for vacation and I couldn't wait to see her reaction. She was so emotional by the view and I just sat there thinking how beautiful she is and how in love with her I am. I didn't plan it out, I had to improvise a ring. She said yes and I want us to move to Spain and be legally married. I want the whole world to know how in love with you I am, Danice.\n",
      "138. I recently realised I was in love with you, but who knows how much time hace I been in love without realising. I hope I will have the courage to confess one day, until then, I will love you just as best friends.\n",
      "139. It was here in Malaga that I had my first kiss with my girlfriend. We fell in love during our two week trip here. I thought it would be impossible for me to ever fall in love with any one and I had completely given up on having relationships with guys my age. So when I by chance kissed my friend in a Clubb on a night out I didn’t think it would lead any where and I wasn’t expecting her to kiss me back… I’d had a crush on her for several months but tried to deny it. When she later that night told me that she’d been in love with me since the first time she saw me my eyes fell up and I couldn’t believe that we were too in what we felt<3\n",
      "140. It was on this beach that I knew for sure that I loved you, and in this town where we admitted how we felt about each other. Our first date was at a paella place across the bridge in the old town. This is where I fell in love with you mi amor. A<3 E\n",

      "WE LOVE YOU.\n",
      "153. The first time I saw you, you immediately fascinated me. Your brown beautiful eyes filled my entire being with hope, love and desire. I thought that I wanted the perfect man but when I saw you, God showed me that I was destined to the most perfect and incredible woman ever alive. No matter what anyone says you are my everything. Building a life with you is a dream and every second with you is a blessing.  Je t'aime.\n",
      "154. Tis is hard, I I realized I'm trans 4 years ago, I'm a minor and I love all the pople that support me but even when we are in a LGBTQAI+ supportive country there're still transphobic and homophobic people EVERYWHERE that\"ll do anything to make you feel like you don't belong anywhere.\n",
      "I love being trans but sometimes it just too much.\n",
      "155. Hated this place so much I prayed and hoped something would change. Being one of the few queer kids was horrifying, I always hoped they wouldn’t find out and I kept as private as possible and only told my friends. I regret that now since I’ve fallen out with them but I switched schools so I probably won’t see them ever again :)\n",
      "To whoever is seeing this, just know, although whatever happened was tough, there’s always going to be someone keeping wanting you to keep going, because they love seeing you thrive, they love seeing you happy, they just love you.

I wish someday you will realice how much i do everyday for keeping all our memories alive and hopefully there will be an “us” again\n",
      "161. I’ve always wanted to kiss someone on the beach and even though we were just friends and it was a short kiss, it was a beautiful moment. The photo of this is hanging in my room and I love looking at it. I was so happy there and didn’t care who might see us\n",
      "162. I still see you here in my arms my love.\n",
      "163. I spend endless summers coming to these same rocks, just to read, listen to music or write, while I watch the sea. It's the place where I feel more at peace, and where I got over my first love. after that, I always come back when my heart is too broken for healing, or I just need time with something as immense as my feelings.\n",
      "164. we started dating when you kissed me right at this station. I know you’re the love of my life, my home, my safe place, and the one who makes sunsets last longer and just glow in so many different ways. I love u\n",

      "166. The first time I saw a gay couple, they kissed and were snuggled on a bench. I attempted to intently watch them without my grandparents (I'm a Brit with Spanish heritage so was visiting Galician family) finding out. I was genuinely mesmerised and they ran past. At that moment, I realised it was okay to be gay. They were athletic like myself at the time and seemed genuinely in love. I didn't think men could be in love, not in this world at least. \n",
